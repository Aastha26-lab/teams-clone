# OMEGA : THE MS TEAMS CLONE
## Microsoft Engage'21 Project
Hey Everone! Welcome to Omega: The ultimate MS TEAMS CLONE.
This is a fully functional Real Time Video Calling Web Application where participants can connect with each other and have video and audio conversation imcorporated with firebase authentication. Participants can also have chat before and after the meeting in their specific chat rooms. Users can create the chat rooms by scheduling corresponding events/meetings on the scheduler.
Along with the collaborative Whiteboard and Voice to Text feature, which helps in not missing any important piece of information. 

**Hosted App:** https://msteams-clone.netlify.app

### How I used Agile Methodology 
* I had a clear vision of the key features that I wanted to build and hence used Agile methodology in order to achieve it on time by building it piecewise.
* I have divided the timeline of 4 weeks into 4 sprints(each of 1 week) and checked my progress at the end of every sprint.
* Took a look at what feature I need to incorporate next and took constant weekly feedback from my mentor and asked for his precise suggestions and clarified my several doubts.
* Everything we built could have flaws so the next step was to debug the code and improvise it. And hence, the planning for the next sprint started after the successful completion of the previous one.
